                <div className="aboutBody">
                    <p>Before beginning my journey as a FullStack Web Developer, I was working as an experienced Church and Community Outreach Coordinator for a non-profit called, Raise the Roof Academy. 
                        My background comes from helping others whether it is through missionary work or nonprofits. God has always given me a heart to serve. Working in the non-profit field gave me the resources to help people and help our community. 
                        It allowed me to solve problems using logic while working with volunteers and working in a team environment. 
                        When a friend introduced me to software development, I realized that the tech field would allow me to continue my love for helping others but in a more creative way.
